# app-qsiprep

This app runs [QSIPrep](https://github.com/pennbbl/qsiprep) on the [brainlife.io](https://brainlife.io/) interface. QSIPrep configures pipelines for processing diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) data. This App implements only the preprocessing piplines (and not the reconstruction pipelines). The preprocessing pipelines are built based on the available BIDS inputs, ensuring that fieldmaps are handled correctly. The preprocessing workflow performs head motion correction, susceptibility distortion correction, MP-PCA denoising, coregistration to T1w images, spatial normalization using ANTs and tissue segmentation.

## Running the App 

### On Brainlife.io

Check out the brainlife app [here](https://doi.org/10.25663/brainlife.app.160)

### Running Locally

A)
  1) git clone this repo.
  2) Inside the cloned directory, create `config.json` with something like the following content with paths to your input files.

  ```json
  {
    "t1": "./t1.nii.gz",
    "dwi": "./dwi.nii.gz",
    "bvals": "./dwi.bvals",
    "bvecs": "./dwi.bvecs"
  }
  ```

  3. Launch the App by executing `main`

  ```bash
  ./main
  ```
  
  ## Output
  
  todo
  
  ### Dependencies

This App requires [singularity](https://www.sylabs.io/singularity/) to run. If you don't have singularity, you will need to install following dependencies. It also requires [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/).
